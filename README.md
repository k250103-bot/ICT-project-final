# **Calorie Calculator Web App**

A simple and interactive web application that calculates **maintenance**, **bulking**, and **cutting** calories based on user inputs such as **age**, **height**, **weight**, **gender**, and **activity level**.
Created as an **ICT project** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 **Features**

* Calculates:

  * **Maintenance Calories (TDEE)**
  * **Bulking Calories** (+surplus)
  * **Cutting Calories** (–deficit)
* Inputs required:

  * Age
  * Height
  * Weight
  * Gender
  * Activity Level
* Clean and simple user interface
* Fully client-side (no backend needed)
* Instant results with JavaScript

## 🧮 **How It Works**

1. User enters personal information.
2. The app calculates **BMR** using the Mifflin–St Jeor equation.
3. BMR is multiplied by an activity factor to get **TDEE**.
4. From TDEE:

   * **Bulking** calories add a surplus
   * **Cutting** calories subtract a deficit
   * **Maintenance** stays equal to TDEE

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
